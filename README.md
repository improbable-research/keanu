## Overview

Keanu is a general purpose probabilistic programming library built in Java and developed by Improbable's research team.
It enables you to build Bayesian networks through which you can make
probablistic predictions about large, complex and multifaceted problems.

This is an early stage, pre-alpha version of Keanu. We have an ambitious team
attempting to build an even more ambitious product with the help of the open source community.

## Contributing Guidelines
 
We have decided to open source Keanu at such an early stage in order to solicit user feedback 
and help guide the product to success.

Whilst we will always welcome contributions, we would value your time more if it 
were spent applying Keanu to challenging problems and locating its strengths and weaknesses.

Please create a Github Issue if you encounter any bugs or have a feature request.
